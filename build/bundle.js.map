This is\n * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways:\n *\n *   1) Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Every payload is\n *      dispatched to every registered callback.\n *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\n *      been executed.\n *\n * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\n * selects a default city when a country is selected:\n *\n *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\n *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\n *   var CityStore = {city: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\n *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\n *\n * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'city-update',\n *     selectedCity: 'paris'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\n *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'country-update',\n *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by both stores:\n *\n *   CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\n * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n * needs to query its data.\n *\n *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n *\n *       // Select the default city for the new country\n *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n *\n *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n *         case 'country-update':\n *         case 'city-update':\n *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n * `FlightPriceStore`.\n */\n\nvar Dispatcher = (function () {\n  function Dispatcher() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, Dispatcher);\n\n    this._callbacks = {};\n    this._isDispatching = false;\n    this._isHandled = {};\n    this._isPending = {};\n    this._lastID = 1;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.
